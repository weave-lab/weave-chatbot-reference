    "### Evaluation Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evaluation results above, we can assess:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - **Response Time**: How quickly each agent type responds\n",
    "   - **Tool Calls**: How well the routing system works (should be 1 tool call per query)\n",
    "   - **Relevancy Score**: Quality of responses (where measurable)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Observations**:\n",
    "   - The teacher assistant should consistently route queries to the appropriate specialized agent\n",
    "   - Each agent type should show consistent performance within their domain\n",
    "   - Response times help identify optimization opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Areas for Improvement**:\n",
    "   - Any agents with high response times\n",
    "   - Queries that resulted in errors or poor routing\n",
    "   - Opportunities to enhance the system prompt or agent coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation framework can be extended with:\n",
    "- More comprehensive test queries\n",
    "- Ground truth answers for accuracy evaluation\n",
    "- User satisfaction scoring\n",
    "- A/B testing between different system prompts"
