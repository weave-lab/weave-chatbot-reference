    "   - **Response Time**: How quickly each agent type responds\n",
    "   - **Tool Calls**: How well the routing system works (should be 1 tool call per query)\n",
    "   - **Relevancy Score**: Quality of responses (where measurable)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Observations**:\n",
    "   - The teacher assistant should consistently route queries to the appropriate specialized agent\n",
    "   - Each agent type should show consistent performance within their domain\n",
    "   - Response times help identify optimization opportunities\n",

    "   - Queries that resulted in errors or poor routing\n",
    "   - Opportunities to enhance the system prompt or agent coordination\n",

    "This simplified notebook provides a streamlined approach to evaluating the Teacher Assistant system using Ollama as the primary judge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- ✅ **Single LLM Judge**: Uses Ollama (llama3.2:3b) for all evaluations\n",
    "- ✅ **Simplified Workflow**: One unified evaluation function \n",
    "- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests all 6 agent types (math, english, computer_science, language, general, today)\n",
    "- ✅ **Clear Metrics**: Correctness and relevancy scores (1-5 scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage:\n",
    "1. Run the setup cells to configure Ollama and initialize the teacher\n",
    "2. Run the comprehensive evaluation to test all agents\n",
    "3. Review the summary statistics and detailed results"
