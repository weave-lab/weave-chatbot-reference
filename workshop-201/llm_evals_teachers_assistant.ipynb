    "# LLM Evaluation Framework for Teachers Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) using advanced frameworks. The evaluation focuses on testing a multi-agent teacher assistant system that routes queries to specialized agents (math, English, computer science, language, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Quick Start - Run to Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook can now run to completion!** The cells have been organized to ensure all dependencies are properly defined before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run the full evaluation:**\n",
    "1. Execute Cells 1-16 in order for basic evaluation\n",
    "2. Optionally execute Cells 17+ for enhanced features (unified evaluation system)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent System Evaluation**: Test routing to specialized agents\n",
    "- **Quality Scoring**: LLM-judge evaluation of response quality  \n",
    "- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and success rate analysis\n",
    "- **Tool Validation**: Verify correct tool/agent routing\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed analysis and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Evaluation Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Legacy Functions** (Cells 1-16): Basic evaluation with compatibility mode\n",
    "2. **Unified System** (Cells 17+): Enhanced evaluation with routing validation and visualizations"

    "1. **`test_queries`** - ~~Simple dict structure~~ → Replaced by `enhanced_test_cases`\n",
    "2. **`test_cases_with_ground_truth`** - ~~Limited coverage~~ → Unified into `enhanced_test_cases`  \n",
    "3. **`evaluate_agent_responses()`** - ~~Basic evaluation~~ → Use `evaluate_enhanced_test_cases()`\n",
    "4. **`evaluate_with_ground_truth()`** - ~~Duplicate logic~~ → Use `evaluate_enhanced_test_cases()`\n",
    "5. **`run_comprehensive_evaluation()`** - ~~Legacy function~~ → Use `run_comprehensive_evaluation_unified()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **NEW UNIFIED STRUCTURE:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`enhanced_test_cases`** - Single comprehensive structure with:\n",
    "- ✅ **Expected Answers**: For quality validation\n",
    "- ✅ **Expected Tools**: For routing validation  \n",
    "- ✅ **Categories**: For organized testing\n",
    "- ✅ **Multi-step Support**: Complex queries with multiple tools\n",
    "- ✅ **Agent Types**: Clear agent targeting\n",
    "- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Can generate old formats if needed\n",

    "### \udee0️ **NEW UNIFIED FUNCTIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`evaluate_enhanced_test_cases()`** - Single evaluation function for all test types\n",
    "2. **`run_comprehensive_evaluation_unified()`** - Comprehensive evaluation with enhanced features\n",
    "3. **`create_evaluation_visualizations_unified()`** - Enhanced visualizations\n",
    "4. **`get_queries_by_category()`** - Backward compatibility helper\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Key Benefits Achieved:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Eliminated Redundancy**: One structure instead of multiple overlapping ones\n",
    "- ✅ **Enhanced Validation**: All tests now validate both quality AND routing\n",
    "- ✅ **Multi-step Support**: Can test complex queries requiring multiple agents\n",
    "- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: {len(enhanced_test_cases)} test cases across all categories\n",

    "# Quick category test\n",
    "math_queries = get_queries_by_category('math')  # Backward compatibility\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **Answer to Original Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**YES - test_queries CAN be obsoleted!** The unified `enhanced_test_cases` structure provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All functionality** of the old `test_queries` \n",
    "2. **Plus expected answers** for quality validation\n",
    "3. **Plus routing validation** with expected tools\n",
    "4. **Plus multi-step query support**\n",
    "5. **Plus comprehensive analytics** and reporting\n",

    "### Evaluation Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evaluation results above, we can assess:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - **Response Time**: How quickly each agent type responds\n",
    "   - **Tool Calls**: How well the routing system works (should be 1 tool call per query)\n",
    "   - **Relevancy Score**: Quality of responses (where measurable)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Observations**:\n",
    "   - The teacher assistant should consistently route queries to the appropriate specialized agent\n",
    "   - Each agent type should show consistent performance within their domain\n",
    "   - Response times help identify optimization opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Areas for Improvement**:\n",
    "   - Any agents with high response times\n",
    "   - Queries that resulted in errors or poor routing\n",
    "   - Opportunities to enhance the system prompt or agent coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation framework can be extended with:\n",
    "- More comprehensive test queries\n",
    "- Ground truth answers for accuracy evaluation\n",
    "- User satisfaction scoring\n",
    "- A/B testing between different system prompts"
